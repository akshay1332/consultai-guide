Usage & Integration for Treatment Recommendations
•	Data Synthesis:
The Virtual Doctor will use the collected data to:
o	Evaluate potential diagnoses using advanced AI algorithms (Gemini API).
o	Cross-reference patient data with medical guidelines and potential contraindications.
o	Generate a tailored treatment plan that includes:
	Medication recommendations (dosing, duration, possible side effects)
	Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, stress management)
	When to follow up with a specialist or seek emergency care
	Local healthcare options (via Google Maps/Places API) for further consultation, pharmacy pickup, or hospital visits if needed.
•	Feedback Loop:
o	The system can prompt the patient for feedback after initial treatment to monitor efficacy and adjust recommendations accordingly.
